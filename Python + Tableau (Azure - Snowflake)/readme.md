## Exploring Apartment Advertisements in Warsaw

Just as a farmer carefully selects the most fertile land for planting crops, real estate professionals must identify the most promising locations for property investments. 
As in agriculture, where the growth of crops necessitates diligent care and timely harvests, the growth of a real estate portfolio demands a proactive approach, seizing opportunities and nurturing investments for continued success.

This project addresses this challenge by leveraging data extraction methods to support the real estate market needs and provide insights into the most suitable locations for agencies to expand their portfolios. Through data-driven visuals, this endeavor strives to provide real estate agencies with valuable insights and recommendations regarding optimal locations for portfolio expansion within the city limits of Warsaw.

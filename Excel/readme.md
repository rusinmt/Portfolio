## Popularity of Hydrogen-Powered Vehicles compared to Electric in California

Analyzing the adoption of hydrogen-powered vehicles and comparing their prevalence to electric vehicles, this project aims to offer valuable insights into the state's journey towards sustainable mobility. The main focus is on a comprehensive analysis of manufacturer engagement, customer preferences, and infrastructure development. Through a dashboard showcasing data sourced from the California Energy Commission, the project unravels trends, challenges, and opportunities that are shaping the future of transportation in this forward-thinking region. The findings and conclusions are insightful for policymakers in the region who could shape policies and incentives to promote the adoption of fuel cell vehicles in the future. Investors in the clean energy and transportation sectors can make informed decisions based on trends and growth opportunities in the hydrogen vehicle market. Automakers can leverage insights to make informed changes in their strategies and marketing.

The portfolio project entailed a comprehensive series of data management and analysis tasks. To begin, Power Query played a pivotal role in appending and transforming the data, ensuring its structure and organization for subsequent analysis. This initial step laid the foundation for a more in-depth exploration of the dataset.

Subsequently, Power Pivot was employed to establish a data model, involving the creation of relationships between different data sets. This phase required a deeper understanding of the queried data to derive meaningful connections and insights. The project delved further into the dataset, implementing advanced functions and techniques, including Find and Replace, Index(Match), SUMIF, and XLOOKUP, to manipulate and extract data effectively.

Handling data in various formats, such as unifying date formats and incorporating geographic data, presented its own set of challenges. The utilization of pivot tables proved invaluable in structuring and summarizing data efficiently. Additionally, conditional data manipulation was achieved through the use of functions like IF() and FILTER(), while custom formatting and DAX measures played a crucial role in presenting key metrics in the dashboard.

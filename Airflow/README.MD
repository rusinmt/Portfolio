## ETL Orchestration Framework

This project encapsulates core concepts of extracting, transforming, and loading data enriched with valuable insights. It aims to automate the process and significantly reduce office worker involvement, making human intervention largely obsolete. The solution is a simplified version of logic prepared for work purposes. It can be hosted on a Linux-based server and scheduled as needed, either triggered when new data flows in or in a timed manner, depending on server traffic and competing tasks.
